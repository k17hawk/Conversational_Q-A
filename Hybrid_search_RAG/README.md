# HYBRID SEARCH IN LANGCHAIN

The standard search in LangChain data is stored as a sparse matrix or dense matrix in vector databases (Astra DB, ElasticSearch, Neo4J, AzureSearch, ...).Since there is limitation and drawbacks. </br>

**Disadvantages of Standard Search in LangChain**  </br>

**Limited Relevance and Accuracy:**  </br>

**Dense-only Search:** While dense vector search captures semantic meaning, it may miss exact keyword matches, especially for rare or specific terms.  </br>
**Sparse-only Search:** Sparse search, such as TF-IDF or BM25, relies on keyword matching and may not capture the broader context or semantic nuances of queries, leading to less relevant results for ambiguous or complex queries.  </br>

**Handling of Rare and Common Terms:**  </br>

**Sparse-only Search:** Can be effective for exact matches but may struggle with synonyms or different phrasings of the same concept.  </br>
**Dense-only Search:** Captures semantic relationships but may not prioritize specific keywords effectively, especially when those keywords are crucial to the query's intent.  </br>
